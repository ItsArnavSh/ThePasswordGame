### The rules
- The user is prompted to enter a password
- The interface asks the user to add numbers
- Then after that, we asked him to add even more stuff
- Until it becomes noticeably irritating
- We will add some more puzzles and riddles to the password game.
- The mission of the user is to find a password that satisfies all the commands
- The conditions must vary so that the same password cannot be copied and pasted.
